    "content": "By proceeding, you agree to the following: <br> <h4> Aadhaar e-KYC Consent</h4> I authorize EasyCred to verify my identity using my Aadhaar number via UIDAI’s OTP/biometric authentication. I permit UIDAI to share my name, DOB, gender, address & photo with EasyCred for KYC compliance under the Aadhaar Act, 2016. <br> <h4>PAN Verification Consent</h4> I allow EasyCred to validate my PAN details with the Income Tax Department and link it to my Aadhaar (if required by law). <br> <h4>Data Usage & Privacy</h4> My Aadhaar/PAN data will be securely stored and used only for regulatory purposes (RBI/SEBI/IRDAI KYC norms). I understand that Aadhaar submission is voluntary unless mandated by law (e.g., for PAN or subsidies). <br> <h4>Right to Revoke</h4>I can withdraw this consent later via UIDAI’s website or by contacting EasyCred support.  <br><br><h4>⚠️ Do not share your OTP/Aadhaar with anyone calling/emailing you</h4>"
