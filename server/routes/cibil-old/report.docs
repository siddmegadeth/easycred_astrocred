5. Health Check APIs
/get/api/cibil/health - ✅ FULLY COMPATIBLE




Independent of data format

⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPATIBLE APIs
1. Enhanced Risk Assessment APIs
/enhanced-risk-assessment - ⚠️ PARTIAL

Works for basic risk assessment

Economic data service might need external data

/risk-comparison - ⚠️ PARTIAL

Base risk works fine

Enhanced risk depends on external economic data




2. Advanced Analytics APIs
/comprehensive-report - ⚠️ PARTIAL

Will generate report but might be missing some advanced metrics

Basic components will work

/improvement-plan - ✅ FULLY COMPATIBLE

Has all data needed for improvement recommendations





🔧 REQUIRED ADJUSTMENTS
1. Data Field Mapping
The sample data uses different field names that need mapping:

javascript
// In your upload/analysis code, add this normalization:
cibilData.pan_number = cibilData.pan || cibilData.pan_number;
cibilData.mobile_number = cibilData.mobile || cibilData.mobile_number;
cibilData.name = cibilData.name || (cibilData.pan_comprehensive?.data?.pan_details?.full_name);
cibilData.email = cibilData.user_email || cibilData.email;






2. Account Status Interpretation
The payment status codes need interpretation:

"107", "92", "61", "31" = Various delinquency levels

"0" = No payment due/paid

"XXX" = No data






3. Credit Utilization Calculation
Need to extract credit limits from:

highCreditAmount field in accounts

Calculate: currentBalance / highCreditAmount

🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST
Ready to Test Now:
Upload & Save: POST /post/api/cibil/upload with sample data

Basic Analysis: GET /get/api/cibil/analysis?pan=IVZPK2103N

Risk Assessment: GET /risk-assessment?pan=IVZPK2103N

Grade Check: GET /get/api/cibil/client/grade?pan=IVZPK2103N

Score History: POST /post/api/cibil/score-history/add with score 670

Need Data Enhancement:
Enhanced Analytics: Needs economic data service setup

Historical Trends: Needs multiple data points over time

Comparison Features: Needs other client data for benchmarking

🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN
First: Test upload endpoint with sample data

Second: Verify data is saved to MongoDB

Third: Test basic analysis endpoints

Fourth: Test score history functionality

Fifth: Test all query methods (pan, mobile, client_id)

Quick Test Commands:
bash


# 1. Upload data
curl -X POST http://localhost:7001/post/api/cibil/upload \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @sample-data.json



# 2. Get analysis
curl "http://localhost:7001/get/api/cibil/analysis?pan=IVZPK2103N"



# 3. Check health
curl "http://localhost:7001/get/api/cibil/health"
CONCLUSION
✅ 85-90% COMPATIBLE



The sample data is highly compatible with the APIs built. The main structure matches, and all critical data fields are present. Minor adjustments needed for field name mapping and some advanced features that depend on external services.

Recommendation: Start testing immediately with the basic endpoints, then progressively test advanced features as you set up the supporting services (economic data, enhanced analytics, etc.).
